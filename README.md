# Projects
- [PKMT (Rust)](https://github.com/TobiasForner/pkmt)
    - import tasks from todoist into different markdown-based note taking systems
    - initially intended for converting between the different markdown flavours used by these systems, but that is still a work in progress
    - partially supported are Obsidian, LogSeq and zk
- morg (Rust)
    - tool for organising music files on PC and (Android) phones (via `adb`)
    - uses discogs API to get more meta data
- auto_summary (Python)
    - customisable tool for generating LaTeX code from PDF files
    - I mostly used this during my time at university to write my own summaries with the lecture material as a basis
- fitnessApp 2 (Android, mix of Java and Jetpack Compose (Kotlin))
    - Android workout and Fitness app
    - initial goal was to have a power-user-focused interface that uses mostly plain text for workout specification
    - also supports weight tracking
    - would like to convert the UI to Jetpack Compose (weight tracking is in Compose already)
    - after the conversion, I would like to try my hand at a more user-friendly UI
- scraper (Python)
    - tool for scraping images from webpages
    - also supports some basic image transformation to make the images follow a standard format
    - also supports converting images to a more ereader-friendly format
    - supports moving files to an android phone (via `adb`)
- image viewer (Jetpack Compose (Kotlin))
    - viewer app (Android) for the scraper tool
- [GraphRepartition (C++)](https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611976489.4)
    - Code accompanying the published version of my Bachelor's thesis, see also https://doi.org/10.1137/1.9781611976489.4
    - the project is about maintaining maximal components of a graph whose connectivity is above some given level $\alpha$
        - the graph may undergo changes like edge deletions, edge insertions or weight increases and these components must be updated in an efficient way
        - potential applications include distributed computing where one would like to place workers that communicate often on the same machine
        - here, the edge weights in the graph represent past communication requests
